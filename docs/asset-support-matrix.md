# FA Asset Support Matrix

The living answer to "which FA content can the bridge deliver to the engine,
and what stands in the way of the rest." Cross-references what
[fx_lib](https://github.com/jomkz/fighters-codex) can decode (pinned at
`extern/fx_lib`, currently v0.3.0) against what the
[fighters-legacy](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy) engine
can consume, and names the transcoding work this repository uniquely owns.

## Purpose & legend

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Ready** | Format fully understood upstream and a working engine pipeline exists. Bridge work can start the moment fx_lib compiles here. |
| **Partial** | A usable subset works today; the gap is documented with its blocker. |
| **Blocked (repo)** | Not usable yet; the named repository owns the blocker. |
| **No engine target** | fx_lib decodes it, but the engine has no consuming subsystem yet. |

**Global gate — lifted.** fx_lib builds cross-platform upstream (fighters-codex
Phase 1) and this repo links it unconditionally on all three CI platforms; the
remaining upstream macOS gap
([codex#155](https://github.com/jomkz/fighters-codex/issues/155)) is proven
here, with fixes flowing upstream. *Ready* verdicts no longer inherit any
build gate — bridge transcoder work can start on every *Ready* row.

## Start-now summary

Content we already have enough information to start bringing into the game:

1. **Aircraft flight models** — every aircraft's thrust, max speed, ceiling,
   fuel, stall, G-envelope, hardpoints, and system damage (`.PT` records) →
   engine FlightModel TOML. The engine flies these end-to-end today.
2. **Entity definitions** — weapons, sensors, ECM, fuel tanks (`.OT`-family
   records) → engine EntityDef TOML.
3. **3D models** — aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, buildings, weapons
   (`.SH`) → glTF `.glb`. 94.9% of the 1,275 stock files decode cleanly.
4. **All 2D art** — cockpit art, menu screens, skins, UI images
   (`.PIC`+`.PAL`, `.RAW`) → PNG, full RGBA8 including transparency.
5. **Sound effects and speech** — PCM audio (`.11K`/`.8K`/`.5K`/`.22K`) →
   OGG Vorbis.
6. **Archive access** — `.LIB` extraction, the prerequisite for all of the
   above.

The definitive per-aircraft roster (which named aircraft have both a
decodable `.SH` and a `.PT` record) requires running `fx` against a licensed
FA install — an early Phase 3 deliverable.

## Category notes

- **Engine validation:** the engine's `AssetValidator` checks every returned
  asset: meshes must carry the `glTF` magic (or lead with `{`), textures
  PNG/KTX2 magic, audio the `OggS` magic, AI scripts must be Lua *source*
  (the `0x1b` bytecode magic is rejected), flight models and entity defs
  TOML text, missions YAML text. The bridge must transcode **before**
  returning bytes — raw FA data is discarded and logged.
- **The 65 machine-code `.SH` files:** ~5% of stock geometry is implemented
  as x86 routines rather than data, including some player-flyable aircraft.
  Decoding them is fighters-codex Phase 5 work; until then those aircraft
  bridge with stats but placeholder geometry.
- **`.LIB` compression coverage:** fx_lib auto-decompresses DCL-compressed
  and raw entries; rare LZSS/PXPK entries are returned still compressed
  ([codex#159](https://github.com/jomkz/fighters-codex/issues/159)).
- **Audio sample rates:** extension encodes the rate; `.22K` → 22050 Hz was
  fixed upstream in fighters-codex #100 (included in v0.3.0).
- **Case sensitivity — implemented:** FA installs vary in filename case; the
  Phase 2 discovery/mount layer matches all FA file names case-insensitively
  by enumeration (ASCII fold; never a literal-path lookup).
- **Type mapping:** the engine's v0.3.x asset-type split re-homes the
  OT-family: `.JT` → Weapon, `.SEE`/`.ECM` → SensorDef, `.OT`/`.NT`/`.GAS` →
  EntityDef. The in-code table (`bridge/src/FaAssetTypes.cpp`) mirrors these
  rows and a table-lock test fails if the two drift. Terrain, AIScript,
  Manual, and Livery deliberately map to no FA extension (no heightmap read
  path yet; engine AI is authored Lua; Manual/Livery are authored content).
- **Cross-LIB precedence:** the mount builds one flat name index like FA's own
  `LibStartUp` hint index (fighters-codex `docs/fa/memory-resource.md`) —
  duplicate names resolve to the last registration. FA registers in OS
  enumeration order; the bridge mounts in case-folded filename order so the
  result is deterministic. FA's loose-file fallback layer is not mounted.
- **Disk-resident libs:** several stock archives ship on the CDs, not the
  install dir (`FA_3`, `FA_7`, `FA_10*`, `FA_11*` — see LIB.md); the mount
  serves whatever is present, so content coverage tracks how full the user's
  install is.

## Maintenance

Docs-currency rule: this matrix is updated **in the same PR** as any change
that shifts a row — a new transcoder, an `extern/fx_lib` bump, or an engine
pipeline landing.
